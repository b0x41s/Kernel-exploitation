RET2USR:
prepare_kernel_cred() - This function can be used to prepare a set of credentials for a kernel service or even better, which fits our use case perfectly, it can be used to override a task's own credentials so that work can be done on behalf of that task that requires a different subjective context. This sounds rather convoluted, but it essentially means, that when we're able to call this we can have a fresh set of credentials back. What's even better is that if we supply 0 as an argument, our returned arguments will have no group association and full capabilities, which means full on root privileges!

commit_creds() - This function is prepare_kernel_cred()'s best friend, as calling this one is necessary to install new credentials upon the currently running task and effectively overriding the old ones. With these two, elevating privileges sounds straightforward!
